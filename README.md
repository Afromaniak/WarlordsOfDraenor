World of Warcraft Emulator - 6.0.1 - Warlords of Draenor - Support Builde 18179 - ** Based TrinityCore **


The WoD project returns headlining .

As those who know us , we had many names , and create a forum for each new extension from its alpha launched .

We are a group of experienced developer . We do not offer our source " opensource " . They are all private .

We were there when Wraith of the Lich King , we were present during Cataclysm , 
we were present at Mist of Pandaria , all our sources have been sold , mostly to Russian and Chinese groups . . .

This time , we're here to meet a terrible challenge. 
" Warlords of Draenor " who has made ​​us very scared when changing " MPQ " to " CASC " .


As each extension , we are a forum for sharing tools will be available for free download our source code will not be available, the database squeezed partly available ( in the repack ) .
